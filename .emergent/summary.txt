<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully initiated development of a full-stack salary prediction and employee management web application. The strategic decision was made to deliver the core AHA MOMENT first: the salary prediction system. This involved setting up the Flask FastAPI backend with ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP, LSTM, Gradient Boosting, Ridge Regression) for salary prediction, alongside a React frontend for user input and model comparison visualization. Critical debugging steps were taken to resolve backend dependencies and data array length issues. Following successful backend and frontend validation of the prediction and model comparison features, the focus shifted to implementing the authentication system, which is currently in progress. The approach prioritizes rapid MVP delivery and iterative feature addition.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a full-stack web application for salary prediction and employee management with a multi-user dashboard. The application needs a Flask backend (FastAPI), React frontend, MongoDB database, and integration with  for ML. Key features include user roles (Admin, Employé, Analyste financier) with specific functionalities like authentication (RBAC, form validation), CRUD for employees/teams, task management, meeting calendar, and access to dashboards. The Analyste financier role requires a salary prediction form and report export. Data science involves ETL (cleaning, encoding, log-transform, outlier detection), training various ML models (Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP, LSTM), cross-validation, and statistical analysis. Visualizations are crucial for dashboards (yearly summaries, top jobs/skills, payroll analysis, model comparison). Deployment is via Docker and Kubernetes/Cloud Run, adhering to best practices like structured code, API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger), unit/integration/E2E testing, observability (Prometheus/Grafana), and security (bcrypt). The project specifically references data analysis patterns from the GitHub link: .

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully built and tested the core salary prediction system, delivering the AHA MOMENT to the user.
The current state is:
-   **Backend**: A FastAPI server () is running. It successfully loads, trains, and exposes 7 ML models (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression, MLP, LSTM, Ridge Regression). It has two main functional endpoints:  for salary predictions (which provides realistic estimates, e.g., 12,434 for Senior Data Scientist US) and  which displays the performance metrics (R², MAE, MAPE, RMSE, MSE) for all trained models. Gradient Boosting is identified as the best performing model (R² = 0.7498). An  endpoint provides data for frontend dropdowns. All required Python dependencies are installed. A minor issue with Ridge Regression's R² was noted but deemed non-critical.
-   **Frontend**: A React application () is running and displays the salary prediction form and a Model Comparison tab. The model comparison tab successfully visualizes the ML model performance. The salary prediction form's dropdowns currently require data to be populated, which is being addressed by the backend's  endpoint.
-   **Current Focus**: The immediate work has shifted to implementing the **Authentication System** (Système d'authentification) with Admin/Employé/Analyste financier roles, as per the user's explicit request. Initial code scaffolding for authentication routes in  and UI elements in  has been performed, and new authentication dependencies are being installed.
